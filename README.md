# ganban

git-based Kanban TUI

## What is this?

`ganban` is a Kanban board that lives in git. The data sits in an orphan branch,
so web UIs shouldn't offer to merge it (but they do). In `ganban`, our tasks
stay with the code and we don't need to rely on external services and API keys.
It's all just files in dirs.

The board's columns are in directories named `id.slug` like `1.backlog`. They're
ordered alphanumerically so the TUI has the same order as `ls -l`. The app will
renumber them for you if you move columns around, or if you used letters or
something other than numbers as an id.

Cards in a column are symlinks to Markdown docs in the `./.all` dir, which holds
the actual data. These links are ordered in the same way as cards. Keeping them
in `.all` gives them stable IDs so you can link to them like you would in a
commit message. You don't need to remember `ln`'s weird syntax though because
`ganban` will round up stray files and replace them with a link.

The first `# heading` in a document will override the title of a card. Other
`# headings` or `## subheadings` becomes a section, and the TUI can choose a
custom editor for sections with special names. This is how comments work, and
how task lists will work in future.

You can add metadata like `labels`, a `due` date, `assigned` - or anything else
that you like - using front-matter. A full JSON/YAML editor is provided for any
custom stuff, and in future it'll be possible to add plugins for new ways to
access and edit this data. Metadata works on columns too, you just edit the
`index.md` file in their dir, which you can use to override the column's style.
And the board also has a title and settings in its front-matter, which is how
we link committers with multiple emails to one identity, or give yourself a 🧔
emoji as your avatar.

When running as a service, `ganban` will sync from remotes that the repo has,
periodically pushing to upstream and resolving any conflicts the best it can.
This creates a kind of mesh network for your board, syncing in the background
without the need for 3rd party services.

Ganban doesn't force you to use its TUI, there's a web UI if you prefer that
sort of thing. If you're a bot or a script or UIs just aren't for you, then you
can use the CLI instead; see `ganban --help`. If you don't want any kind of
interface then use your own text editor and commit directly to git.

It can sync in the background with `ganban sync -d`, or, if the daemons haunt
you, just omit the `-d` for a one-time sync.

## Data Model

### Cards

Canonical card files live in `.all/` with 3-digit numeric IDs:

```
.all/
  001.md
  002.md
  003.md
```

Card format:

```markdown
---
whatever: put your metadata here
---
# Title

Main description goes here, displayed in the body. You can link to other cards
by ID like #1

## Notes

Subsequent sections become sidebar panels in the TUI.

## Comments

- [name](mailto:user@email): comments go here like this
```

### Columns

Directories with 1-digit numeric prefix for ordering:

```
1.backlog/
2.in-progress/
3.done/
```

### Board Layout

Cards appear in columns as symlinks with 2-digit position prefix:

```
1.backlog/
  01.fix-login-bug.md -> ../.all/001.md
  02.add-feature.md -> ../.all/003.md
2.in-progress/
  01.refactor-api.md -> ../.all/002.md
```

- Symlink name = position + slug (derived from card title)
- Moving card between columns = delete + create symlink
- Reordering within column = rename symlinks
- Archiving = just delete the symlink, card stays in `.all/`
- Orphaned cards (in `.all/` but not linked) accessible via TUI

### Numbering

Default digits: 3 for `.all/`, 1 for columns, 2 for symlinks.

## Git Integration

### Reading/Writing Without Checkout

Operates on the `ganban` branch without checking it out, using git plumbing:
- `git show ganban:path` to read
- `git hash-object`, `git mktree`, `git commit-tree` to write
- Or GitPython equivalents

### Multi-Remote Sync

- One upstream (push target)
- Optional peer remotes (extra fetch sources)
- Fetch all remotes periodically
- On detecting changes: commit local, rebase, push upstream
- Changes propagate opportunistically through whoever can reach upstream

## Philosophy

- **Permissive**: don't be prescriptive, let users mess with files
- **Resilient**: handle broken states gracefully, offer to fix
- **Minimal**: derive what you can (titles, order), front-matter is opt-in
- **Portable**: works with any markdown renderer, any git host, any editor
