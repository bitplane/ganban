# comment editor

When we get a "comments" section, we should use a custom editor to add comments to a list.

It'll work like this:

The first bullet pointed list in the markdown becomes a comment section

It's got an editbox at the bottom, which adds a comment as the current user.

```markdown
* comment here -
  [user](mailto:email)
```
