# blocked by

Let's extend blocked so it's "blocked by" rather than a simple "true/false". It can be a card id, or a list of card ids. If falsey the status is removed.

When a card is created, it watches all of it's dependencies' meta sections:

* When blocked status is updated, it maybe updates its own style
* When dependencies are changed, the watchlist changes and its blocked class stuff is updated.

We'll probably need to discuss how this is cached and propagates to work on the card details screen.
