# blocked by

Let's add a "depends" to cards, so we can do dependency chains and a card's blocking status.

It's either an id or a list of ids of other cards. If the list is made empty then it gets deleted.

When a card is created, it watches all of it's dependencies' meta sections:

* When blocked status is updated, it maybe updates its own style
* When dependencies are changed, the watchlist changes and its blocked class stuff is updated.

We'll probably need to discuss how this is cached and propagates to work on the card details screen.
