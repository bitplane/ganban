# dependency graph

once we have blocked by as a thing, we should add a tab that shows deps as a diagram.

we should probably keep this as abstract as possible so we can use it to make an inline mermaid viewer later.

worth discussing as it's quite a big and fun/cool thing to work on. it needs some design rather than one-shotting
