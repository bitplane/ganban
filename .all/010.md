# Keyboard nav on board

* up/down/left/right should navigate to column headers
* I think treat the "add column" as just another column here.
* we might also want to move up into the board titlebar
* if we do that, we'll also need to allow up/down movement from the single line editor

will need a bit of back and forth during testing, and discussion beforehand.

cancelled because we can't do this easily due to menus being ediable. we can address it later I guess
