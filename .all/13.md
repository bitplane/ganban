# add AGENTS.md

Need to create an agents.md so it's not so token consuming to explore the project each time.

Things to include:

* project overview
* project structure / where to find the code
* data model + watchers design
* don't run all the tests (it's slow, user will do it)
* caution, it's a large codebase
* we are dogfooding ganban, so use the cli app to manage tasks on the kanban board
