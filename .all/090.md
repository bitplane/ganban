# #card completion

So let's make it so when we type # we get a drop-down and it let's the user select a card like #10 or whatever.

Here's how it should work:

On pressing #, if the character before is a space, we highlight the "#", add a search-box thing for cards (same as in the deps drop down) and replace the highlighted text with the ticket id like `#id` as they choose one via list selection. On choice, remove the highlight and advance by 1 char like it was typed.

If the text they type isn't in the list, like `#fail` then it'll just be `#fail` or whatever was typed in.

On pressing space, the editor should cancel and close
