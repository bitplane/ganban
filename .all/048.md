# text search/entry drop-down

Let's add an advanced freeform text selector/search widget.

It'll look like this:

```
search   X
row 1
row 2
row 3
```

Search box: editbox that acts like a browser address bar
X: the DELETE icon, cancels to return None as answer
row 1..N: list of items that get filtered by the search text. These are a menu list that filters contents
