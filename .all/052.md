# user email editor

Now we've got the nice email search thing on the card details screen, I think we should use it when editing board users.

But it needs to be a little bit different I think. This is a searchable drop-down menu that isn't searching board users by email, it's just searching for git committer emails. For the moment anyway. Point is, it's not a user search like the other one.
