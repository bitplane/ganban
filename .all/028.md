# add card ID to card details screen

When Claude and I are discussing tasks, it knows the card ID but I can't even see it in the UI.

So we need to put it somewhere so that we can discuss it with a nice short name. I'm thinking that in future we can write a parser that links to cards too, so we can flip between them on ctrl+click or similar, and have them referenced like `#1` in the markdown.

So I'm thinking that the best place to put it is in the titlebar, on the left before the title itself. Like:

```
#1 - Title of the card
```

So the feature is to make a label that has the `#1 - ` part on it, and the card title goes after it on the right.
