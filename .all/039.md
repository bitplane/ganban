# UI: widget gaps

gaps in the widget bar feel wonky.

* let's move "delete date" into the calendar popup as a "select None" type thing, and remove the hover thing and forced gap after the date icon
* Remove the unasign thing from the user selector too, and put it at the top of the drop-down. Same thing.
* use 1 cell padding between widgets. applies to the column editor too
* remove the forced " " after current widgets, because it makes the highlight funny. keep 'em square.
