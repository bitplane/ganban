# arrow key movement

I reckon there's something up with arrow keys on the main board.

When I press -> and move from the compact column into a comfy one, it selects a card that's way lower down. When I move back again, it's all in the wrong place.

I reckon it should use the same sort of thing as the drag/drop, where it selects based on the position. I think "go left/right to this height" might be a better idea than "go to this index"

Not sure if this should also apply to context menus. Feels like it should. Dunno though. If we do that we might need to make that more abstract, and we'll cock everything up if we do that 'cause you have no fuckig eyes Claude.
