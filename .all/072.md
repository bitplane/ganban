# Editor selection

For the subheadings on the right column of markdown doc editor, we're gonna need a way to auto-select an editor class for the region, and use that instead of the section editor.

The only selectable, and the default one, will be the section editor at the moment.

But we'll add other ones in. This change is to add a way to choose these, and work on a design for an interface/API for them. They'll basically be the viewer/editor pattern.
