# search text widget

We'll need an editbox that acts like an address bar's autocomplete thing.

That is, it has a list of options at start.

You type into it, it searches the options and auto-completes the first match in highlight after the user entered text.

Pressing DEL deletes the highlight and disables search until the next keypress.

While searching, you get a drop-down list below it with filtered items.

Let's discuss requirements properly. The idea is to use this for:

1. Email/user search/addition
2. Label search/addition
3. Card search (when we add blocked: id)
