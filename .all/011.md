# keyboard menu nav

Keyboard navigation in menus, (specially the emoji picker and colour selector) doesn't respect the column you're in as you navigate, and seems to select when you go off the edge too.

This needs some UX love; moving up or down needs to pass the current X position (or index? not sure) to the menu item we're selecting.
