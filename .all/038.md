# `#id` parser

In a similar way to how mailto: links are parsed, let's also parse things like #1 or #0001 and replace them with a card summary.

So when #38 or similar is found in this ticket, it gets replaced with [#038 \`#id\` parser](card:038) in the markdown viewer.

We can intercept these links later on. For the moment though, we'll just make the links work.

### Examples

- #1
- #038
- #0038
