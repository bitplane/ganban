# done flag

I'm thinking we have "done" as a datetime by default.

But if it's a bool we should support that too I guess, since we can't control what users will enter.

We should also look at adding something to the cards to show which ones are done. In Trello they have a checkbox that you click on the left side of the card title. Not sure we want this, but we probably want an indicator for it

Also right click -> [ ] Complete / [x] Complete or something?

Not sure, let's discuss.
