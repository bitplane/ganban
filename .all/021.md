# sync - cli

Let's add a "sync" option to the CLI that will run the git commands to sync the repo - or at least try to.

It should `exit` if the sync fails due to an unrecoverable merge conflict.

We'll need to investigate the sync code, and this will probably lead to more work on implementing node tree merging and automatic resolution too. Or it might not, not sure.

But for the moment, we'll have `ganban sync` and `ganban sync -d` like the README.md promises.

We'll need to talk about the difference between push and pull, tracking branches, remotes, time between pulls, and what a good strategy actually looks like.
