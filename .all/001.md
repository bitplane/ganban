# card labels

* tickets get a list of labels
* use a stable hash to link name to colour
* board level overrides for colour, like with users
* add colour to header of tickets

On cards:

* __ __ __ in different colours on card in column
* in compact view it'll be a bit different. Maybe set the text background colour.

Detail view:

* drop-down selector for known labels

Board view:

* we'll need a label editor tab where you set the name of the labels.

Renaming:

We'll need a way to rename all labels. Either just use numbers, or have some kind of metadata watcher and change process going on.
