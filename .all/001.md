# card labels

Need to discuss this one. See how it's the first ticket we ever had? Well, yeah. Things have changed since then

---


* cards get a list of labels in meta
* use a stable hash to link name to colour
* board level overrides for colour, like with users
* add colour to header of cards

---

On cards:

* __ __ __ in different colours on card in column
* in compact view it'll be a bit different. Maybe set the text background colour.

Detail view:

* drop-down selector for known labels

Board view:

* we'll need a label editor tab where you pair names with colours.
