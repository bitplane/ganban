# card labels

* tickets get a list of labels
* use a stable hash to link name to colour
* board level overrides for colour, like with users
* add colour to header of tickets

On cards:

* __ __ __ in different colours on card in column
* " " for first label, "▌" with different fore and background colour for second. " ▌" for third and so on.
* drop-down selector for known labels

Renaming:

We'll need a way to rename all labels. Either just use numbers, or have some kind of metadata watcher and change process going on.
