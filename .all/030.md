# sync UI

The zzz icon when idle is blue, which is borderline invisible in the default font. Let's change it to 🟢 for online and instead of the stop icon, let's use 🔴 to mean offline.

The tooltip is too verbose. Let's just have the board.git.sync.status text directly as the tooltip. It'll need to update on change in a reactive way of course, if it doesn't already.
